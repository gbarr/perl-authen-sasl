Authen::SASL - SASL Authentication framework


DESCRIPTION
-----------

SASL is a generic mechanism for authentication used by several network
protocols. Authen::SASL provides an implementation framework that all
protocols should be able to share.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

The following modules must already be installed before attempting to
build Authen::SASL:

  * Perl, at least version 5.005
  * Digest::MD5
  * Digest::HMAC_MD5
  * Test::More (only required to run the test suite)


INSTALLING
----------

Once the prerequisites are met the module is built and installed in the
standard manner:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Depending on how perl is set up, the last step above may require elevated
privileges.
